Implement:
Numbers Validation and Series Setting;
1) Working Series (List) 
	1.1) Check Implementation (if-else)
	1.2) External Argument Validation (if-else)
	1.3) Implement User Input option

Using:
Main() - Calls on Validate() to check the number series and starts Menu() when complete.

Validate() - Checks for three positive numbers in a list

Build Menu;
2) Choices Available to be printed;
	2.1) Input a new series - replaces current series and 	validates again
	2.2) Display the order it is already in (loop)
	2.3) Display in reversed order (loop)
	2.4) Display sorted order (use Sorted [later sort by your 	own function])
	2.5) Find the max 
	2.6) Find the min
	2.7) Find the average
	2.8) Find the Count
	2.9) Display the sum
	2.10) Exit program
Using:
NewSeries() - Starts collecting new numbers and adds them to the list, then replaces the old list with the new one
CurrentOrder() - Loops through the List and prints by order
ReverseOrder() - Loops through the List from the end to the start and prints vals
SortedOrder() - Displays the List in the correct order, offers from high to low or from low to high in a sub-menu
SeriesMax() - Displays the highest value Looping though and saving the highest in a separate variable
SeriesMin() - Displays the lowest value Looping through and saving the lowest in a separate variable
SeriesAverage() - Displays the series average by using SeriesSum() and SeriesCount() 
SeriesSum() - Loops through the variables and adds them up
ExitProgram() - Exits the program by changing bool of flag
